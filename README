README file for $ADAQ_REPO/lib

This directory contains the following original sources:
--> adaq/ : The ADAQ source (C++ code and libraries)
--> caen/ : The CAEN firmware, drivers, and libraries


This directory also contains directories that hold all of the required
ADAQ and CAEN libraries and header files in a single location for
convenience (during builds and so forth):
--> i686/ : libraries required for i686 (32-bit) architectures
--> x86_64/ : libraries required for x86_64 (64-bit) architectures
--> include/ : header files 



Detailed description of the CAEN directory 'caen/'
-------------------------------------------------- 
CAEN libraries required to build the any of the ADAQ codes This top
level directory contains the original CAEN source code and li braries,
as well as two directories that are marked "x86" and "x86_64", which
contain the 32- and 64-bit libraries, respectively, required for
building on the different architectures. The main purpose for
including the libraries here is for explicit control of CAEN library
versions and for portability to a number of machines (that may or may
not have CAEN libraries installed). A brief description of each
library can be found below

Detailed description of the ADAQ directory 'adaq/'
--------------------------------------------------
The ADAQ library, which contains all the customized controls of the
V1720 digitizer and V6534 high voltage boards. The libADAQ.so library
is build from the ../src and ../include directory by the
../Makefile. Please see those files for details
