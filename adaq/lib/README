README file for ADAQ libraries

This directory contains the two types of shared libraries in further
subdirectories categorized by architecture (32- or 64-bit)

0) CAEN libraries required to build the any of the ADAQ codes This top
   level directory contains the original CAEN source code and
   libraries, as well as two directories that are marked "x86" and
   "x86_64", which contain the 32- and 64-bit libraries, respectively,
   required for building on the different architectures. The main
   purpose for including the libraries here is for explicit control of
   CAEN library versions and for portability to a number of machines
   (that may or may not have CAEN libraries installed). A brief
   description of each library can be found below

1) the ADAQ library, which contains all the customized controls of the
   V1720 digitizer and V6534 high voltage boards. The libADAQ.so
   library is build from the ../src and ../include directory by the
   ../Makefile. Please see those files for details



------------------------------------------------------------
-- Brief descriptions of the CAEN libraries (and version) --
------------------------------------------------------------

--CAENComm-1.02 : header files (includes) and library functions for
                  general communication with CAEN VME devices
                  (e.g. the V1720 digitizer, the V6534 HV power
                  supply, etc).

--CAENVMELib-2.30.2 : header files (includes) and library functions for
                      general operating system (OS) to VME communication
                      via one of several possible links (USB, optical,etc). 

--CAENVMELib-2.30 : ** See below **

--CAENDigitizer-2.2.1 : header files (includes) and library functions for
                        general communication with the CAEN digitizer modules

--CAENDigitizer-1.3.1 : ** See below **

--x86 : contains 32-bit OS compatible libraries from the above
      	directories.  This directory is specified to the
      	compiler/linker via the project makefile

--x64 : contains 64-bit OS compatible libraries from the above
      	directories.  This directory is specified to the
      	compiler/linker via the project makefile



** At present the CAENDigitizer-2.2.1 + CAENVMELib-2.30.2 prevent
   opening both the V6534 and V1720 boards simulataneously. Totally
   unknown reason that I can't figure out at present. However, these
   libraries are required to correctly interact with the CAEN DT5720
   desktop digitizer unit. The older version of the libraries
   (CAENDigitizer-1.31 and CAENVMELib-2.30) are provided here until
   the bug is found.
